     <h3> Google Play – Known Issues</h3>
     <p>
      It can take 1-14 days for Google to verify your identity when creating a developer account. Some students have reported even longer wait times. There is no way around this. There is a $25 fee to create a developer account. They also require an android device for setting up the account. If you don't have one, you could borrow a device for that part of the process or use a differnent host. Some students utilitze Git Pages and include a download link on the page.
      </p>  
    <p>
      For Mobile App Projects, automated scripts are not a part of the proccess and you won’t need to include them when a task requests it.
      </p>  
<p>
      	  Please don't panic if you see the message about needing testers for publication. See below for a way you can submit task 4 without publishing.</p> 
       <p> 
      You do not have to publish your app for Capstone. To circumvent the need for a link to your hosted project, 
	       you can request an internal test track through Google. </p> 
	<h3>Instructions for Test Track</h3>
     
      <ol>
        <li> Request Internal Test Track through Google.</li>
        <li>Set up a dummy gmail account and password for evaluation to login. Add it to the list of testers approved.</li>
        <li>Include the gmail and password in instructions to evaluation.</li>
      </ol>
