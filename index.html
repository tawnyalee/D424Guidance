    <h1>D424 Software Engineering Capstone</h1>

    <p>D424 Software Engineering Capstone Birds-eye Overview</p>
Four-task Process and Resource Guide</br>

<p>*If you decide to submit a mobile app, it's a good idea to set up your developer account on that platform NOW, especially if you are using Google Play. We can't control the time it takes them to verify identify and sometimes this process can take 1-3 days or up to 2 weeks. Starting now should keep you from having to wait for them to finish to submit future tasks. Only cloud-based web and mobile apps qualify for Capstone D424. Standalone apps do not qualify. 

<p>Modifying past projects is allowed. Capstone instructors aren't always familiar with every possible programming course available in Java and C# tracks. Review the Task 3 Requirements in section B to determine what needs to be added. It is the student's responsibility to know what additional features need to be added to past projects.
Task 1: Project Approval
The first step is to download the approval form below this article and complete it. Once you've filled it out, send it to your instructor. They’ll sign it and return it to you so you can submit it through the course with the waiver as proof that you have Instructor approval. See the Task 1 article for more information and to see answers to commonly asked questions.
</p>
 

<p>Task 2: Business Proposal
In Task 2, you’ll be describing the following as it pertains to your project:

<p>The Customer (Who will use this app and why)
The Business Case (How the app helps the customer)
Fulfillment (How the app will fulfill the business needs of the Customer. Describe the app features, how it will appear, and how outcome is presented)
Functionality (How the application will interface with other systems, how its functions will be enabled by the user, and what type of results it will provide)
Deployment (Explain the deployment process, Deliverables, Project Timeline, and Costs and how the code will be validated and verified to be working)
Please view the Task 2 Breakdown for more details. In it, we address commonly asked questions and provide templates and samples.
</p>
<p>Task 3: The Code
This is the most work-intensive of all the tasks. View this breakdown to gain a better understanding of what is required. It also provides links to resources and addresses commonly asked questions. We would also recommend that you complete task 4 before writing any documents for task 3. It will be impossible to address each section in task 3 without knowing how you deployed your application. Do not submit tasks 3 and 4 at the same time. They will not pass task 4 if task 3 has not passed yet. If you need help troubleshooting your code, please send the code to your capstone instructor with screenshots of the error message. You may send code snippets or a link to your GitLab repository. If you send a link to your repository, please tell us the name of the file throwing the error. Provide as much detail as you are able to provide. We expect and hope you will spend time troubleshooting on your own because it is a valuable learning experience. However, if you are unable to fix bugs within a few days, please let us know.
</p>
 

<p>Task 4: Deployment
In Task 4, you’ll deploy your code and discuss why you chose your Cloud provider. You’ll also describe how you used container images. View this breakdown for how to approach containers if you don't use them, as well as other commonly asked questions. We do not recommend hosting companies. However, here is a compiled list of hosting company options for web apps and mobile apps.
