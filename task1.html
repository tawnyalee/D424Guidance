            <h1>D424 Software Engineering Capstone - Task 1</h1>

            <p>
               
                Your first step in D424 is to decide on a project idea and get approval from a course instructor.
                <mark>Approval cannot be handled over a phone call because we have to sign the form itself.
                    It can only be handled through email.</mark> If you are developing a mobile app and are using Google
                Play for required deployment, it is recommended you sign up now for a developer account. Google's process
                can take anywhere from 1-3 days, however, we have noticed that sometimes it can take several weeks.
                To avoid an unexpected delay, we urge you to start that process now.
            </p>

            <h2>The approval process:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Complete the form (also linked below this article) and <mark>email it</mark> to your instructor.</li>
                <li>The instructor will either approve it or request more information/send feedback for revisions.</li>
                <li>Once the instructor emails your signed form, you will then submit it through Task 1 in the Course of Study as proof that your project has been approved by an instructor.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Please include app-type (mobile or web) and language for backend development.
                Leaving this information off your form will result in longer approval times.</p>

            <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
            <p>To qualify for approval, your app must be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It should be a full stack web-based application or a mobile app. Plug-ins, applets, and desktop apps are not allowed.</li>
                <li>It must be hosted in the cloud.</li>
                <li>Use a database that allows end users to insert, update, and delete data entries.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Explanation of Approval Form Fields:</h2>

            <p><b>INFORM INSTRUCTOR:</b></p>
            <p>Potential use of proprietary company information: (Y/N)</p>
            <div class="instructions">Most students don't use proprietary company information. If you do choose to use a project built for work, you must mark this as 'Y'.</div>

            <p>LANGUAGE(S):</p>
            <div class="instructions">List the major programming languages you'll use for your project.</div>

            <p>Application Type:</p>
            <div class="instructions">Please mark whether it is a web app or a mobile app.</div>

            <p>Project topic AND description:</p>
            <div class="instructions">Tell us what type of app (mobile, web-based).</div>

            <p>Project purpose AND goals:</p>
            <div class="instructions">Tell us what your app will do.</div>

            <p>If your version of the form has the words "predictive" and "descriptive", you can delete them. They have no relevance in the context of software engineering.</p>

            <b>DESIGN and DEVELOPMENT:</b>
            <p>Explain why the problem and software product you have proposed are worthy of study:</p>
            <div class="instructions">Any reasonable answer will do. This isn't really evaluated and any reasonable answer is accepted.</div>

            <p>Projected outcomes and deliverables:</p>
            <div class="instructions">Any reasonable answer will do.</div>

            <p>Estimated number of hours for the following:</p>
            <div class="instructions">Estimates are fine. This is meant as an exercise to consider how long it might take for each step of the process. You are not expected to meet these time estimates.</div>

            <ul>
                <li>Planning and design</li>
                <li>Development</li>
                <li>Documentation</li>
                <li>Total</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Projected completion date: <div class="instructions">Again, an estimate is fine.</div></p>
           
            <br>
            <b>IMPLEMENTATION and EVALUATION:</b>
            <div class="instructions">Describe how you will approach the execution of your project: A bulleted or numbered list highlighting the various steps you'll take is fine.</div>

            <h2>RELEASE FORM</h2>
            <p>You only need a release form if you are using proprietary information (code) from an employer or other source. If you aren't borrowing code, the approval form is the only thing you need to submit in Task 1. If you are using a project from work, which is the most common reason to use the release form, your employer will sign it. Its purpose is to show you have permission to use that code. You do not need to have a signed release form to use libraries.</p>

            <p>If you have further questions on a project idea, please reach out to your instructor.</p>
