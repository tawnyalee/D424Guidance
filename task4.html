		<h1>D424 - Task 4</h1>
		<p>You've made it to the last task! In task 4, it's all about deployment. 
			(In this instance, deployment refers to properly uploading code to either an app store or a
			cloud-based hosting solution, such as AWS or Azure.) In this task, you'll deploy your code to your 
			elected host, provide responses to a few questions, and create a video explaining your deployment 
			process. You can select any host that works for your project. Here are compiled lists of hosting 
			company options for web apps and mobile apps.
		</p>
	  	 <p>In Task 4, you'll be submitting the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The document where you answer the two questions,</li>
			<li>Your Panopto video,</li>
			<li>A link to your Gitlab Repo,</li>
			<li>A zipped file of your Gitlab Repo, and</li>
			<li>A link to your deployed app (if you use Google Play, this would be a link to the test track.)</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>The writing in task 4 is minimal. You need to submit a document explaining why you chose the hosting provider you did. 
			Addressing this in the video will not be accepted. Provide a reasonable answer. Responses such as, 
			"It's the only one available" are not acceptable. Demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of your options and 
			your logic behind your choice. It is ok if your reasons are financial or based on the host's popularity in the market.</p>
		<p>
			You also have to discuss containers. Containers are not required. If you did not use containers, simply explain why 
			it wasn't necesary. Any reasonable explanation will be fine. "Because it wasn't required" isn't good enough. 
			Demonstrate your knowledge of the purpose of containers and why you didn't need them to complete deployment.
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of task 4, you have one more video to create. In this video, document the process you used for deployment. 
			You don't have to appear on camera. It is a simple "how-to" video that demonstrates the steps you took in the deployment process. 
			Take the viewer through the process it took to deploy the app to your hosting provider. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Students are required to zip up their code and submit this as well. If you didn't use automated 
			scripts for deployment, you don't need to worry. It's not a requirement. 
			<mark>Some students find their zipped code is too large to submit. If this happens to you, 
			evaluation has asked us to tell students to zip the code, push it to the repo, and inform them of this in a note to the evaluator.</mark>
